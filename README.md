### Serverless_Project

## Description

For this project,I have craft a serverless web app leveraging AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and S3. Users will have the capability to perform CRUD operations - Create, Read, Update, and Delete - on items stored in a DynamoDB table.

# Steps

* Create a DynamoDB table to store the items.  
* Build a Lambda function to handle the CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table.  
* Use S3 to store and host the web application's static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). 
* Create a CloudFront distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency.
